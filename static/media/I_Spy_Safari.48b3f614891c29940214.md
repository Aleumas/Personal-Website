# I Spy Safari

## The Start

My design technology teacher (Sudra) expressed frustration with this simple problem: his children got bored traveling on safari trips. Sudra explained that he and two other teachers had been looking into creating an app to solve this problem. After graduating high school, I decided to develop this app out of curiosity. Little did I know, after showing Sudra what I had come up with, he would want me to continue the app's development.

## Swift Changes

I developed the app in Swift: an IOS programming language. Apple updates Swift yearly, similar to its iPhone releases. Consequently, I had to stay vigilant during the app's developmentâ€”looking out for potential deprecations. Although frustrating at times, this improved my refactoring skills.

## Iteration

There were seven beta releases involving consistent communication between the three teachers and me. After each beta release, we discussed present issues and the compromises needed to move on. The last beta release was released after I had implemented the app's core functions:
- Provide animal insights
- Track seen animals
- Manage previous trips

Sudra and a couple of other teachers tested the app in the Nairobi National Park with their children. Their testing raised constructive feedback: which led to many functional and cosmetic improvements.

## Conclusion 

The app is on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/i-spy-safari/id1564427163) and has a [website](http://ispysafari.com/) for more information. I Spy Safari is now contributing to [The Mara Elephant Project](https://maraelephantproject.org/): aiding an effort to prevent animal poaching.
